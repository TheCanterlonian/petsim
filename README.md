# petsim
petsim is a tamagotchi-like game i am developing. It is a fairly large project but i am confident that it will be completed eventually. It is the most organized project i have ever created. When it has been completed, i will move on to the Metal Labs Proof-of-Concept Game using petsim functionality as a base to build off of. The working files have been labeled "petsim2" because there was a setback in the early development that initiated a full rewrite from scratch.

petsim uses the filesystem to save and load profiles and game state in the directory it is working in. There are a few files that are used by default, including:
<br>
error.txt - contains the latest crash report
<br>
iconL.png - the large icon used by the GUI
<br>
iconS.ico - the small icon used by the GUI
<br>
init.xml - contains startup values for petsim
<br>

<br>
template.xml - contains default values for creating new save files
