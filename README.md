# petsim
petsim is a tamagotchi-like game i am developing. It is a fairly large project but i am confident that it will be completed eventually. It is the most organized project i have ever created. When it has been completed, i will move on to the Metal Labs Proof-of-Concept Game using petsim functionality as a base to build off of. The working files have been labeled "petsim2" because there was a setback in the early development that initiated a full rewrite from scratch.
